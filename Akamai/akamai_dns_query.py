- How to test staging environment:

To spoof, enter the domain and IP in your host file, or use testing tools like curl or wfetch.
Host file entry example: {} {}
Note: 
- Don’t execute the tests from either the office or VPN as the most of the office’s IPs are whitelisted in Akamai.
- To make sure you are hitting the staging environment you have to be able to see in the response header the HTTP header: x-akamai-staging: ESSL
- If for some reason you are not able to change your host file, it might means you are getting blocked by Zscaler, in this case, please inform to me your e-mail so you can be whitelisted.
